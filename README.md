# Similarities_Recommendation_system_NLP
Applying Similarities algorithms on NLP based data and creating Recommendation Systems

A common problem to be solved while working with a recommender system is to design (or select) a metric function, such as it could be used to calculate similarities between two and more items.
In this assignment I compare papers using different similarity methods – “Jaccard similarity” and “Cosine similarity’.

The project includes the following:

- task.pdf - which explains the aim of the project and describes the overall algorithm
- stop-words_english from 1 to 6.txt - a set of stop words, which are common in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications
- Jaccard_and_Cosine_Similarities.ipynb - a project itself, done in Jupyter Notebook

The project extracts abstracts of the papers via online, so the project also includes web-scrapping as well.
